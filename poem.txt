-Live in the moment 
*mountains
-as you will never experience this again
*Ocean
-this feeling is one in itself
*desert
-it rushes past
*lake
-without a noise
*music/instrument
-just like time
*clock
ticking away on a clock
*waves
enjoy the present
*clouds
as you wonâ€™t know what the future will bring
*sunset
